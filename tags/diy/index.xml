      <description>A good friend of mine was having her 30th birthday party. The party had a disco/rave room, where everyone went and had a good time dancing to the music. While the world itself is what it currently is, I decided to bunker down for 2 weeks to make sure that I would not spread any diseases to my good friends. This made it impossible to go and get epic rave gear.</description>

      <description>Prologue Logitech Extreme 3D Pro is a legendary joystick/flightstick, however you want to say it. It was released in 2003 and it is still in production and sold for around 50â‚¬. You can get these for cheap. The joystick itself is really basic, but gives you a good variety of buttons and features for a small price. Even if the name gives you a small hint, that there might be a casual version of the joystick, but on the contrary, there isn&amp;rsquo;t.</description>
