I built my first custom mechanical keyboard 19th of August, 2019. never would I have thought that I&rsquo;d ever build 50 of them. It&rsquo;s been crazy and feels unbelievable. The 50th keyboard is going to be a special one. I am giving it away in my Twitch channel!
The 50th keyboard
I decided to go with a SixtyFive keyboard by Mode Designs.

Itâ€™s been crazy and feels unbelievable. The 50th keyboard is going to be a special one. I am giving it away in my Twitch channel!\nThe 50th keyboard I decided to go with a SixtyFive keyboard by Mode Designs. The SixtyFive keyboard (also known as Mode65) is a highly configurable keyboard with a 65% layout.\nPre-rendered photo of SixtyFive by [Mode Designs](https://shop.modedesigns.com/blogs/updates/updates-introducing-the-sixtyfive)\nThe giveaway keyboard has the following configuration:\nName Description Top Blue-Grey Bottom Blue-Grey Backpiece Brass Plate Black Aluminum / ISO Plate Foam No PCB ISO Hotswap Silicone Base None Plate Caps Black Feet Black You should also be able to see the exact configuration from this link: Mode65\nKeycaps Keycaps are douleshot PBT keycaps from Tai-Hao. They have nordic layout, so you can enjoy your Ã„, Ã–, Ã… responsibly!\nA random 65% with Tai-Hao Exotic Nordic keycaps\nSince they are doubleshot keycaps, they should be wear-resistant as well. These keycaps are affordable, but still of good quality!\nSwitches \u0026 stabilizers This was a hard choice to make. There are two options for switches:\nTacile: Durock T1 67g Linear: Lavender 65g Everyone has their own preference for the switches, but having a huge amount of available choices would have been absurdly hard and difficult to manage. Both of these choices are really good switches. Some consider these the best of their own categories. The SixtyFive is a hotswap keyboard, so the winner will be able to swap the switches to their own preference, if these are not up to the winnerâ€™s standards ðŸ˜Ž\nSwitches will be lubed by me, of course.\nStabilizers are Durock v2 stabilizers. Color depends on the switches; either smoke grey or clear/transparent ones.\nRules The following rules apply for this giveway:\nMust live in Finland Must be following me on Twitch Has to use 5000 channel points to participate Has to fill the form that I will give in Twitch/Discord DM Only 1 participation per person Filling more than 1 form wonâ€™t have any effect, I will be checking them manually If you try to bamboozle me, your entry will be denied Q: Why 5000 channel points requirement? This is to make sure that someone, who actually has followed me a long time really wins this. I probably wouldnâ€™t be at this point without the constant support and amazing discussion Iâ€™ve had during my keyboard build streams on Twitch. This keyboardâ€™s value is pretty high (500â‚¬+), so I really, really want someone who I know to win this. #based\nAlso, for the most active people on my stream chat, I will be giving the spot on the giveaway without 5k channel point requirement. Thanks for supporting me â™¥\nHow to participate? Go to https://twitch.tv/hekeke and spend the 5k channel points reward thingy.\nThe giveaway will be held before christmas, no idea on when exactly, but stay tuned ðŸ‘€\nAlso huge shoutout to Linda for sponsoring big part of this keyboard! Otherwise youâ€™d had to settle for a lesser keeb !\n","wordCount":"523","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://heke.io/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"2021-11-28T19:36:59+02:00","dateModified":"2021-11-28T19:36:59+02:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://heke.io/posts/giveaway/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Heikki Stark","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://heke.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://heke.io/ accesskey=h title="Heikki Stark (Alt + H)"><img src=https://heke.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=22>Heikki Stark</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://heke.io/posts/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://heke.io/keyboards/ title=Keyboards><span>Keyboards</span></a></li><li><a href=https://heke.io/about title="About Me"><span>About Me</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://heke.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;Â»&nbsp;<a href=https://heke.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">50th keyboard - Giveaway</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2021-11-28 19:36:59 +0200 EET'>28 November, 2021</span>&nbsp;Â·&nbsp;3 min&nbsp;Â·&nbsp;523 words</div></header><div class=post-content><p>** GIVEAWAY IS OVER **</p><p>I built my first custom mechanical keyboard 19th of August, 2019. never would I have thought that I&rsquo;d ever build 50 of them.
