This whole video was shot on my old apartment, in a quite smallish place and didn’t even take that long to shoot! Altogether it was a fun evening with keebs and cameras and friends.\nThe reason I am doing this “portfolio” is that I think this might be the best way to show people what kind of custom keyboards I’ve been building/assembling/consulting/whatever.\nMy keyboards KBD67 rev 2.0 On the contrary to the common belief, I don’t collect keyboards. I only have two keyboards - one for home and one for work.\nMy daily driver, KBD67 rev2.0. © Olli Granlund\nThis one is my “daily driver” and my current “endgame” keyboard. The only thing that I am missing is a wireless PCB. It seems that the technology to do wireless custom keyboards is not just there. I have made a few USB-cables myself, so that the cable looks pretty neat, but I’d love to have a full wireless setup.\nHere are the exact specs of my #1 keyboard:\nPart Part name PCB KBD67 rev 2.0 USB-C Switches Zilents v2 62g (lubed with Superlube) Case KBDfans low-profile aluminium case, black Plate Brass Plate Keycaps GMK Wavez Stabilizers GMK Screw-in (clipped, band-aid and heatshrink modded) With this keyboard I tried to aim for as silent as possible keyboard, which I think I succeeded in pretty well, except for the spacebar. That thing is still loud, because of the long stabilizers that the spacebar uses. That rattle sound is pretty hard to get rid of, even with modified stabilizers.\nDZ60 rev 3.0 This one is my keyboard, that I (sometimes) have with me at work.\nDZ60 rev 3.0. © Olli Granlund\nPart Part name PCB DZ60 rev 3.0 USB-C Switches Zilents v2 62g (lubed with Superlube) Case KBDfans low-profile aluminium case, red Plate Alumium plate Keycaps NPKC Blank rainbow keycaps Stabilizers GMK Screw-in (clipped) For this being a keyboard I keep at work, it had to be as small and quiet as possible. I don’t want to be the guy with the loud clickety clackety clacker keyboard. What is special about this, is that the normal 60% layout keyboards don’t have dedicated arrow keys. By using a smaller left shift and 1U sized right shift, you can squeeze in the arrow keys. This is one of the best things when getting a custom keyboard, you get exactly what you want. I’ve had colleagues say that the sound of this keyboard is pretty pleasant and not disturbing. The keycaps are rainbow, because they were the cheapest around that time :)\nThis was also my very first custom keyboard that I’ve built.\nCommissions Most of the keyboards that I’ve built has been commissions and I’ve streamed a few of them on my Twitch channel. There a lot of people have asked questions and I’ve answered them on livestream.\nCheck out the Keyboards page for more information on these :)\nDZ60 The most common type of keyboard that I’ve built is a DZ60 keyboard. It is a pretty cheap, but it still has pretty good features.\nI won’t go too much in to the details of these, since they are almost clones of each other.\nDZ60, Zilents v2 65g, acrylic TOFU case and amazing artisan keycaps\nThis one has a pretty cool theme going on. It has a few artisan keycaps and the spacebar is making me jealous as heck. The USB-cable is made by me, it has a aviator GX14 connector and MDPC sleeves. The DZ60 has underglow LEDs and it shines nicely through the slightly frosted acrylic TOFU case.\nThanks LepiJopi for this project!\nDZ60, Zilents v2 67g, aluminium TOFU case\nWhat’s cool in this project, was the case. TOFU case weighs a lot. The 60% version is a chunk of aluminium.\nKBD67 rev 2.0 This one was made for Ville Erkkilä, they guy who made the most of the earlier video.\nKBD67 rev2.0\nPart Part name PCB KBD67 rev 2.0 USB-C Switches Zilents v2 62g (lubed with Superlube) Case Aluminium TOFU case, purple Plate Aluminium Plate Keycaps NPKC sunset gradient keycaps Stabilizers GMK Screw-in (clipped, band-aid modded) The coolest thing about this project was once again the weight. I remember weighting this keyboard and the scale showed something around 1,5 - 2,0 kg. That is a lot of weight for a keyboard of this size. The case also has a brass weight on the bottom.\nWonderland Lubrigante This has been the most interesting project for me.\nWonderland Lubrigante. © Olli Granlund\nPart Part name PCB Wonderland Switches Gateron Silent Ink Black (lubed with Krytox) Case Lubrigante acrylic case Plate Integrated Keycaps GMK 9009 Stabilizers GMK Screw-in To get something special like this, you need to be kinda active in the keyboard community. These things are ordered with a group-buy format. If you are too late to the party, you may need to wait a long time for the keyboard parts to go for a new round. If you get to the group-buy, you still have to wait for the parts to be finish manufacturing.\nThis is a split ergonomic keyboard. The idea is that when you rest your hands on top of they keyboard, they sit on a more natural position.\nThanks ElPedró for this epic project!\nKBD75v2 KBD75v2\nPart Part name PCB KBD75v2 USB-C Switches Gateron Silent Ink Black (lubed with RO-59tmKT) Case Aluminium KBD75v2 case Plate Brass plate Keycaps Tai-Hao Miami PBT keycaps Stabilizers Cherry Screw-in (clipped, band-aid modded) Yet again, one heavy keyboard. KBD75v2 PCB also has underglow LED lights, so the red stripe you can see in the picture has a smooth glow, which can be customized to your liking. The 75% layout includes a full F-row (F1 to F12 buttons). The KBD75v2 also supports a numpad, but then you have to make bigger compromises.\nThis one is for my good friend Joakim!\nQuestions \u0026 answers If you happen to have any questions regarding keyboards or memes, you can hit me up on Twitter or wherever you might get a hold of me :)\nQ: Why do you lube the switches?\nA: The lubricant (lube) reduces the amount of friction within the switch. By adding the lube, you can make the switches smoother and more silent. Lube is definitely worth the extra time from my point of view. This takes a lot of time though.\nQ: What is a stabilizer and what do the mods mean?\nA: Stabilizers are used together with the longer keys, i.e. spacebar, enter etc. The modifications are pretty well documented by RAMA. The idea is to reduce the sound. Stabilizers are the loudest part of the keyboard.\nGMK stabilizers\nQ: Are you open for commissions?\nA: Yes. Hit me up on and we’ll discuss more!\nQ: What about nordic characters (Ä, Ö, Å)?\nA: There are considerably less keycap sets with ääkköset. I understand that some people look at the keyboard when they are typing, but you have more choices regarding keycaps if you don’t mind having wrong alphas in the keys.\nGood stores Store URL Location Candykeys https://candykeys.com/ Germany MyKeyboard https://mykeyboard.eu/ Belgium KBDfans https://kbdfans.com/ Asia KPrepublic https://kprepublic.com/ Asia Not affiliate links, not endorsed or anything.
