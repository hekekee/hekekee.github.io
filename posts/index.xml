      <description>&lt;p&gt;** GIVEAWAY IS OVER **&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I built my first custom mechanical keyboard 19th of August, 2019. never would I have thought that I&amp;rsquo;d ever build 50 of them. It&amp;rsquo;s been crazy and feels unbelievable. The 50th keyboard is going to be a special one. I am giving it away in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitch.tv/hekeke&#34;&gt;Twitch channel&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-50th-keyboard&#34;&gt;The 50th keyboard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to go with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://shop.modedesigns.com/blogs/updates/updates-introducing-the-sixtyfive&#34;&gt;SixtyFive&lt;/a&gt; keyboard by Mode Designs.
The SixtyFive keyboard (also known as Mode65) is a highly configurable keyboard with a 65% layout.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good friend of mine was having her 30th birthday party. The party had a disco/rave room, where everyone went and had a good time dancing to the music.
While the world itself is what it currently is, I decided to bunker down for 2 weeks to make sure that I would not spread any diseases to my good friends. This made it impossible to go and get epic rave gear.
To come up with something, I decided to start making a &lt;strong&gt;rave stick with addressable LEDs&lt;/strong&gt;! To my confusion, I could not find any similar project released as an open source project. The electronics within this project can easily be translated to cosplay projects or whatever else ðŸ˜Š The files are available on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4939787&#34;&gt;Thingiverse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Logitech Extreme 3D Pro is a legendary joystick/flightstick, however you want to say it. It was released in 2003 and it is still in production and sold for around 50â‚¬. You can get these for cheap. The joystick itself is really basic, but gives you a good variety of buttons and features for a small price. Even if the name gives you a small hint, that there might be a casual version of the joystick, but on the contrary, there isn&amp;rsquo;t. Only for Pros&#39;!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been gettting a lot of requests and questions about mechanical keyboards. Mostly because of this one video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this video, I want to give a short shoutout to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/VilleErkkila&#34;&gt;Ville ErkkilÃ¤&lt;/a&gt; and Kiehu Creative for coming up with the idea and filming the amazing video. This whole video was shot on my old apartment, in a quite smallish place and didn&amp;rsquo;t even take that long to shoot! Altogether it was a fun evening with keebs and cameras and friends.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
