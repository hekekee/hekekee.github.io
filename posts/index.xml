      <description>** GIVEAWAY IS OVER **
I built my first custom mechanical keyboard 19th of August, 2019. never would I have thought that I&amp;rsquo;d ever build 50 of them. It&amp;rsquo;s been crazy and feels unbelievable. The 50th keyboard is going to be a special one. I am giving it away in my Twitch channel!
The 50th keyboard I decided to go with a SixtyFive keyboard by Mode Designs. The SixtyFive keyboard (also known as Mode65) is a highly configurable keyboard with a 65% layout.</description>

      <description>A good friend of mine was having her 30th birthday party. The party had a disco/rave room, where everyone went and had a good time dancing to the music. While the world itself is what it currently is, I decided to bunker down for 2 weeks to make sure that I would not spread any diseases to my good friends. This made it impossible to go and get epic rave gear.</description>

      <description>Prologue Logitech Extreme 3D Pro is a legendary joystick/flightstick, however you want to say it. It was released in 2003 and it is still in production and sold for around 50€. You can get these for cheap. The joystick itself is really basic, but gives you a good variety of buttons and features for a small price. Even if the name gives you a small hint, that there might be a casual version of the joystick, but on the contrary, there isn&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been gettting a lot of requests and questions about mechanical keyboards. Mostly because of this one video.
For this video, I want to give a short shoutout to Ville Erkkilä and Kiehu Creative for coming up with the idea and filming the amazing video. This whole video was shot on my old apartment, in a quite smallish place and didn&amp;rsquo;t even take that long to shoot! Altogether it was a fun evening with keebs and cameras and friends.</description>
